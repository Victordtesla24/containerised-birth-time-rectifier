Let me start by breaking down the user's requirements. They want four main techniques covered: advanced shader-based parallax mapping, camera movement strategies, multi-layered parallax, and performance optimizations for mobile. Plus code examples and references to specific implementations.\n\nFirst, I'll review the provided search results to gather relevant information. The search results include several sources on parallax mapping in WebGL and Three.js, depth perception techniques, camera movements in Three.js, multi-layered parallax implementations using CSS/JS, and performance tips for mobile.\n\nStarting with shader-based parallax mapping: Search result [1] from apoorvaj.io explains different techniques like normal mapping, parallax mapping steep parallax mapping etc., which are essential here. Also [3] from Babylon.js docs talks about Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM), which is a more advanced technique than basic normal maps. LearnOpenGL's entry [14] also details how POM works with multiple samples for better accuracy.\n\nFor camera movement strategies that enhance depth perception: Search result [8] discusses shadows and camera positioning in Three.js but might not be directly relevant. However NASA's article on depth perception using Spitzer telescope data [11] mentions how changing perspective can simulate distance\u2014this could relate to dolly zoom or other camera techniques mentioned in another source like the Hitchcock zoom example from search result [15]. Also motion parallax via face tracking from Vivien000's blog [13], where moving the camera based on user head position creates depth cues.\n\nMulti-layered Parallax Implementation: Codepen example [9] shows a multi-layered approach using CSS/JS layers moving at different speeds\u2014this concept can be adapted into Three.js by layering geometries or planes with varying displacement based on scroll or movement inputs as seen in YouTube tutorial links like video[12].\n\nPerformance optimization for mobile devices comes up in MoldStud\u2019s article[17], emphasizing reducing draw calls via BufferGeometry merging & simplified shaders; also low-poly models help reduce GPU load which is crucial since mobiles have weaker GPUs compared desktops so these points should be included here along possible use of logarithmic depth buffers mentioned briefly elsewhere (search result[16]).\n\nNow structuring each section:\n\n1) Advanced Shader-Based Parallux Mapping:\n   - Start with Normal vs Parallux Mapping differences (from sources 1 &14).\n   - Explain Steep Parallux then move onto POM.\n   - Code example integrating POM into custom material similar to threejs.org\u2019s example but adjusted per user needs.\n   \n2) Camera Movement Strategies:\n   - Discuss dolly zoom effect (Hitchcock/Vertigo effect) as per codepen link[15].\n   - Motion Parallux through face tracking (source13).\n   - Use logarithmicDepthBuffer if dealing large coordinates preventing z-fighting(source16).\n\n3) Multi-Layerd Approach:\n    Reference Codepen\u2019s layer separation method applied within WebGL context perhaps using multiple planes each displaced differently when scrolling occurs; maybe adapt code snippet showing layered scene setup similar Patrick Westwood\u2019s tutorial but translated into threejs terms instead of CSS transforms.\n\n4.Performance Optimization Tips For Mobile Devices:\n    Highlight key points from MoldStud articles such as reducing polycount via LOD systems(mentioned source17), combining meshes where possible(BufferGeometry merge), texture atlases usage instead individual textures per object thus minimizing draw calls etc., plus enabling logarithmicDepthBuffer if needed(source16).\n\nCode Examples Needed Throughout Each Section:\n\n- In Shaders section provide GLSL snippets demonstrating how displacement is calculated step-by-step especially steep steps vs occlusion sampling methods.\n- For Camera Movements show JS code adjusting FOV while dollying forward/backward maintaining object size thus creating vertigo effect.\n- Multi-layer part could involve setting up multiple PlanesGeometry instances each offsetting UV coordinates based scroll position perhaps? Or maybe vertex displacement based layers?\n- Performance tips would include practical examples like merging geometries or switching materials when necessary depending device capabilities detected through UA sniffing or feature checks.\n\nCitations From Sources Must Be Properly Integrated:\n\nEach technical point made should reference appropriate search results e.g., when explaining POM cite source3(Babylon docs mention it uses height map alpha channel alongside normal maps). When discussing physics integration cite source2(MoldStud article mentioning compute shaders handling physics simulations efficiently). \n\nNeed To Ensure All Four Sections Are Covered With Sufficient Depth And Each Subsection Flows Naturally Into Next Without Lists But Through Narrative Paragraphs As Per Report Format Guidelines Provided Earlier By User Which Prohibits Bullet Points Or Lists That Break Flow So Must Convert Any List-Like Information Into Continuous Text With Topic Sentences Connecting Ideas Logically Together While Maintaining Academic Tone Required By Style Guide Specified In <report_format>.\n\nAlso Check That Citations Are Applied Correctly After Relevant Sentences Using Brackets Like This[1][3]. Avoid Having A References Section At End Since Instructions Say Not To Include One Instead Cite Inline Only As Per <citations> Rules Given Beforehand Which Require Up To Three Sources Per Sentence Enclosed Within Their Own Brackets Without Spaces Between Words And Citations Etc..\n\nFinally Ensure Code Snippets Are Marked Properly With Syntax Highlighting Where Applicable Such As GLSL Blocks For Shaders Or JavaScript Examples Showing How To Implement Dolly Zoom Effect Using THREE.Camera Methods Alongside OrbitControls If Necessary Based On Source15 Discussions Around Calculating FOV Changes Dynamically During Animation Loop Updates Within Render Function Calls Etc..\n</think>\n\n# Enhancing Depth Perception and Immersive Parallax Effects in Astronomical Visualizations with Three.js  \n\nThe quest for realistic astronomical visualization demands sophisticated approaches to simulate cosmic phenomena accurately while maintaining interactive performance across devices.
