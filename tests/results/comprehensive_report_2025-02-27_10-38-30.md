| Endpoint | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Health Check | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| Geocoding API | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| Initialize Questionnaire API | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| Next Question API | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| Analysis API | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| Chart API | 200 | ✅ PASS |

### 3. Frontend Page Tests

| Page | Status | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Home Page | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| Birth Details Page | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| Questionnaire Page | 200 | ✅ PASS |
| Analysis Page | 200 | ✅ PASS |

### 4. End-to-End UI Tests

End-to-end user flows were tested and verified:

| Test Case | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Navigate from Home to Birth Details | ✅ PASS | Title and form elements verified |
| Fill Birth Details Form | ✅ PASS | Form submission and validation working |
| Geocoding Location | ✅ PASS | Successfully retrieves coordinates |
| Navigate to Questionnaire | ✅ PASS | Session data correctly passed |
| Answer Questions | ✅ PASS | Responses recorded, next questions displayed |
| Access Analysis | ✅ PASS | Rectified birth time and chart displayed |

### 5. Component Tests

Individual components were tested for correct rendering and functionality:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| North Indian Chart | ✅ PASS | Renders correctly with provided chart data |
| Confidence Indicator | ✅ PASS | Shows correct colors based on confidence level |
| Loading Indicator | ✅ PASS | Displays during asynchronous operations |
| Celestial Background | ✅ PASS | Parallax effect works as expected |

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Next Question API Request Format**
   - **Issue:** The Next Question API initially returned 422 errors due to incorrect request format
   - **Fix:** Updated the request payload to include proper `questionId` and `answer` fields within a `response` object
   - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

2. **API Path Consistency**
   - **Issue:** Some API endpoints were inconsistently prefixed with `/api/`
   - **Fix:** Standardized all API calls to include the `/api/` prefix
   - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add more detailed error messages for API failures
   - Implement consistent error handling across all components

2. **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Add more test cases for edge conditions (e.g., invalid birth details)
   - Create stress tests to evaluate performance under load

3. **Monitoring**
   - Implement continuous monitoring using the health check script
   - Set up alerts for service disruptions

## Conclusion

The Birth Time Rectifier application passes all critical test cases and is functioning as expected. The application demonstrates good performance and reliability across all tested components. The few issues identified during testing were successfully resolved.

The application is ready for deployment with minor recommendations for future improvements.
