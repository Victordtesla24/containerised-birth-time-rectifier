{"model": "sonar-deep-research", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a senior AI systems architect with expertise in astrological software systems, containerized AI services, OpenAI API optimization, and Vedic astrology. Your advice must be practical, production-ready, and focused on achieving high precision in astronomical calculations and birth time rectification."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I am developing a birth time rectification application using containerized services. My OpenAI service currently implements a dual API key system (PRIMARY/Business and SECONDARY/Personal keys) with intelligent key selection based on task type, performance metrics, and budget management. The current implementation includes error categorization, retry logic, and performance scoring for keys.

I need comprehensive research and recommendations on two key areas:

1. Advanced optimization strategies for dual API key usage:
- Beyond simple failover, what advanced patterns can maximize reliability while minimizing costs?
- How to implement predictive quota management to avoid hitting rate limits?
- What task-specific routing strategies would be most effective for astrological calculations?

2. Containerized AI agent architecture for 100% accurate birth time rectification:
- How to implement a multi-agent system within Docker containers for birth time rectification?
- What architecture would enable dynamic, personalized questionnaires that adapt to user responses?
- How to achieve 80%+ confidence scores in birth time rectification algorithms using planetary calculations?
- Strategies for improving the accuracy of Vedic chart generation and planetary position calculations?

Please provide specific architectural recommendations, implementation patterns, and technical approaches that would work within my existing containerized environment."}], "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1, "top_p": 0.9, "frequency_penalty": 1}
