# Project Progress Status

## Recently Completed
1. Test Script Consolidation
   - Merged run-app-flow-test.sh and run-application-and-tests.sh into consolidated-app-flow-test.sh
   - Enhanced script with menu-driven interface option
   - Added support for all application test flows
   - Improved error handling and service management
   - Enhanced API endpoint validation
   - Created constants.js for centralized test data management

2. Test Flow Implementation
   - Ensured all flows from implementation plan are testable:
     - Complete astrological chart application flow (A→B→C→D→E→F→G→H→I→K→L→M)
     - Validation failure path (A→B→C→B)
     - Low confidence path (G→H→J→G)
     - Boundary cases with extreme coordinates
     - API endpoint validation
   - Created specialized test data for each flow
   - Added utility functions for common test operations

3. API Endpoint Management
   - Created constants.js file for centralized API endpoint definitions
   - Ensured consistent usage of API endpoints across all tests
   - Added health check endpoint handling
   - Improved validation of API endpoint consistency
   - Added support for alternative endpoint paths
   - Enhanced error reporting for endpoint issues

4. TypeScript Linter Error Resolution
   - Fixed 25+ TypeScript linter errors across multiple files
   - Added missing 'aspects' array to ChartData objects in multiple tests
   - Implemented proper type checking for 'ascendant' property
   - Updated BirthDetailsForm to use correct BirthDetails structure
   - Fixed Date vs String type conflicts with proper formatting
   - Updated LifeEventsQuestionnaire tests for current implementation
   - Created missing components to fix import errors
   - Modified tsconfig.json for better type checking and module resolution

## Current Status
- All test patterns from the implementation plan integrated
- Consolidated test script operational with improved functionality
- Test constants centralized in constants.js file
- 5 distinct test patterns implemented:
  1. Complete astrological chart flow
  2. Validation failure flow
  3. Low confidence flow
  4. Boundary cases tests
  5. API endpoints validation
- All required API endpoints correctly defined
- Consistent testing approach across all flows

## Next Actions
1. Test the consolidated script with all test patterns
2. Verify API endpoint consistency across the application
3. Enhance documentation for test approach
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
5. Add more boundary and edge cases
6. Improve test reporting and visualization

## Success Metrics
