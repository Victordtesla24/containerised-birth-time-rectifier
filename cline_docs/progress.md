# Progress Log

## March 7, 2025 - Modularization of Visualization Components

### Completed
- Split `Nebula.jsx` into smaller, focused modules:
  - Created `src/components/three-scene/nebula/*` components
  - Extracted shader code into `NebulaShaders.jsx`
  - Separated material creation into `NebulaMaterial.jsx`
  - Moved common shader utilities to `utils/ShaderUtils.jsx`
  - Extracted texture loading logic to `utils/TextureLoader.jsx`

- Split `ShootingStars.jsx` into smaller modules:
  - Created `src/components/three-scene/shootingStars/*` components
  - Separated individual star rendering into `ShootingStar.jsx`
  - Maintained system management in `ShootingStars.jsx`

- Created forwarding modules for backward compatibility:
  - `src/components/three-scene/Nebula.jsx` → `nebula/Nebula.jsx`
  - `src/components/three-scene/ShootingStars.jsx` → `shootingStars/ShootingStars.jsx`

- Fixed ESLint warnings:
  - Converted anonymous default exports to named objects
  - Added proper JSDoc documentation
  - Ensured consistent casing in imports

- Documentation:
  - Created `docs/code-refactoring-summary.md` with details of improvements

### Next Steps
- Apply similar modularization to `PlanetSystem.jsx`:
  - Extract planet-specific code to separate modules
  - Move utility functions to shared locations

- Refactor `CelestialCanvas.jsx`:
  - Split post-processing effects into separate modules
  - Extract performance monitoring components

- Unit testing:
  - Create tests for the newly modularized components
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

- Implementation of Perplexity API suggestions:
  - Analyze best practices for Three.js performance optimization
  - Apply recommendations from Perplexity to improve rendering efficiency

### Technical Debt
- Some hardcoded references to file paths might need updating
- Test coverage for new components should be implemented
- Performance profiling should be conducted to verify improvements
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Test automation
- Performance monitoring

## What Needs Work

### Identified API Gaps
1. **API Router Issue**: The `/api` prefix routing is not working correctly
   - Status: Workaround in place (dual-registration)
   - Priority: High

2. **Session Management**: No session initialization or management
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Priority: High

3. **Authentication/Authorization**: No JWT implementation
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Priority: High

4. **Chart Comparison Service**: Implementation incomplete
   - Status: Partially implemented
   - Priority: Medium

5. **Interpretation Service**: Documentation and implementation incomplete
   - Status: Partially implemented
   - Priority: Medium

6. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket implementation for progress tracking
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Priority: Medium

### Frontend Improvements Needed
- Real-time progress updates for long-running processes
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Client-side authentication integration
- Chart comparison visualization
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Accessibility enhancements

### Backend Improvements Needed
- Fix API router configuration
- Implement session management
- Add authentication/authorization
- Complete chart comparison service
- Standardize error handling
- Add WebSocket support
- Implement interpretation service
- Enhance questionnaire flow

### Documentation Needs
- Complete API reference documentation
- Update sequence diagrams for all flows
- Create developer guides
- Add code examples
- Improve troubleshooting information

## Recent Accomplishments

1. Created comprehensive flowcharts documenting:
   - API integration between frontend UI components and backend services
   - Detailed sequence diagram showing request/response flow
   - Gap analysis highlighting implementation issues
   - Implementation plan with prioritized tasks

2. Identified key API architecture issues and created implementation plans.

3. Developed detailed timeline and resource requirements for addressing gaps.

## Upcoming Milestones

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
- Fix API Router Issue
- Implement Session Management
- Add Authentication/Authorization

### Phase 2: Feature Completion (Weeks 3-4)
- Complete Chart Comparison Service
- Standardize Error Handling
- Add WebSocket Support

### Phase 3: Service Enhancements (Weeks 5-6)
- Improve Documentation
- Enhance Questionnaire Flow
- Implement Interpretation Service

## Blockers and Challenges

1. **API Router Configuration Issue**
   - Impact: Requires dual-registration workaround
   - Resolution Plan: Investigate FastAPI router configuration, identify root cause

2. **Session Management Design**
   - Impact: Delays authentication implementation
   - Resolution Plan: Design session architecture, determine persistence mechanisms

3. **Authentication Integration**
   - Impact: Security implications, delayed protected features
   - Resolution Plan: Research authentication options, implement JWT solution
