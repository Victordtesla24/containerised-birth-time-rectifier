# Birth Time Rectifier - Active Context

## Current Work Details

We are currently implementing the Birth Time Rectifier application according to the specified requirements. The core focus is on ensuring that all test cases pass in the test_consolidated_api_flow.py file, which verifies the end-to-end functionality of the application.

## Recent Changes

No recent changes have been made yet, as we are just starting the implementation.

## Current Tasks

1. **Fix Test Failures**
   - Make the python pytest tests pass, particularly focusing on the test_consolidated_api_flow.py file
   - Implement all required API endpoints
   - Ensure proper session management
   - Complete chart generation and verification functionality
   - Implement questionnaire and birth time rectification features

2. **Backend Implementation**
   - Complete the AI service implementation with all required endpoints
   - Ensure proper integration with OpenAI for verification
   - Implement the ephemeris calculation engine for accurate planetary positions
   - Add proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. **API Gateway Implementation**
   - Complete the API Gateway configuration
   - Implement all required routes for forwarding requests to the backend
   - Add appropriate middleware for session management and error handling

4. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Implement the chart visualization components
   - Create the questionnaire interface
   - Add the birth data entry form
   - Implement the results display with rectified time

## Next Steps

1. Run the tests to identify all failing tests
2. Implement the required functionality to fix each failing test
3. Verify all features work correctly
4. Run the complete test suite to ensure all tests pass
5. Deploy the application

## Priorities

1. Backend API implementation
2. API Gateway connectivity
3. Chart generation and visualization
4. Questionnaire and birth time rectification
5. Export functionality
