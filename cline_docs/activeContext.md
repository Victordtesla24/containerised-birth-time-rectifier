### Current Focus
Test Consolidation and API Endpoint Architecture Consistency

### Latest Changes
1. **Consolidated Test Scripts**
   - Merged run-app-flow-test.sh and run-application-and-tests.sh into a single script
   - Added comprehensive CLI options for flexibility
   - Implemented menu-driven testing interface
   - Enhanced error handling and service management

   - Ensured consistent usage of API endpoints across all tests
   - Added health check endpoint handling
   - Improved validation of API endpoint consistency
   - Implemented dual-registration pattern with proper documentation:
     - Primary endpoints with `/api/` prefix (e.g., `/api/chart/validate`)
     - Alternative endpoints without prefix (e.g., `/chart/validate`)
   - Enhanced error reporting for endpoint issues
   - Verified proper nesting of chart endpoints under `/api/chart/` and `/chart/`
   - Updated implementation_plan.md with comprehensive API architecture details

     - Validation failure path (A→B→C→B)
     - Low confidence path (G→H→J→G)
     - Boundary cases with extreme coordinates
     - API endpoint validation

### Active Files

### Known Issues
- None currently identified

### Recent Achievements
- Successfully consolidated test scripts
- Created centralized constants file
- Improved test organization
- Enhanced API endpoint management
- Ensured all application flows are testable

## Summary

The API endpoint architecture has been fully standardized and documented. The application now implements a dual-registration pattern for all API endpoints, providing both primary endpoints (with `/api/` prefix) and alternative endpoints (without prefix) for backward compatibility.

Key accomplishments:
1. Implemented a consistent dual-registration pattern for all API endpoints
2. Removed all redundant router backup files and other backup files
3. Updated documentation in implementation_plan.md, technical_state.md, and systemPatterns.md
4. Created comprehensive api_architecture_docs.md with detailed information
5. Updated progress.md to reflect the completion of the API endpoint architecture tasks
6. Ensured consistent endpoint usage across frontend and tests through constants.js
7. Standardized API response formats across all endpoints
8. Added proper error handling for all endpoints

The API endpoint architecture is now fully documented and implemented consistently across the application, with a clear pattern for future development.
