# Birth Time Rectifier - Vercel Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the Birth Time Rectifier application for deployment on Vercel, following both the standard and incremental migration approaches outlined in Vercel's documentation.

## Migration Approach

We've adopted a **hybrid approach** to deploying on Vercel:
1. **Standard Deployment**: Initial setup with basic CI/CD pipeline
2. **Incremental Migration**: Feature-by-feature transition following Vercel's recommended vertical migration strategy

## Changes Made

### 1. Basic Vercel Configuration

- Created `vercel.json` with settings for:
  - Build and deployment configuration
  - API headers for proper CORS handling
  - URL rewrites for routing
  - Environment variables

- Added GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml` for:
  - Continuous integration and testing
  - Automated deployment to Vercel
  - Preview deployments for pull requests

- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude Vercel-specific files and directories

### 2. Incremental Migration Setup

Following Vercel's [Incremental Migration](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-migration) recommendations, we've:

- Implemented feature flags system to toggle between legacy and new implementations
- Created middleware for handling feature detection via cookies, headers, and URL parameters
- Added example components demonstrating the feature flag system
- Updated configuration to support phased feature rollout
- Created documentation for the migration process and roadmap

### 3. Utility Scripts

To facilitate the migration process, we've created several utility scripts:

- `scripts/prepare-vercel-deployment.js`: Sets up the basic Vercel configuration
- `scripts/consolidate-for-vercel.js`: Optimizes the project structure for Vercel
- `scripts/setup-incremental-migration.js`: Implements the incremental migration approach
- `scripts/get-vercel-project-info.js`: Helps obtain necessary Vercel IDs

### 4. Documentation

- `docs/vercel-deployment-guide.md`: Comprehensive guide for deployment
- `docs/incremental-migration.md`: Outlines the incremental migration strategy
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`: Quick reference guide for deployment
- Updated `README.md` with Vercel deployment information

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Core Frontend (Current)
- Basic UI components
- Form handling
- Chart visualization (without advanced features)
- Basic routing and navigation

### Phase 2: API Integration (Next)
- Connect to backend APIs (either through Vercel Functions or external API)
- Implement feature flags for backend functionality
- Set up environment variables in Vercel

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- AI-powered birth time rectification
- Comprehensive questionnaire system
- Advanced chart comparisons

## Deployment Instructions

### Standard Deployment

1. Run the preparation scripts:
   ```bash
   node scripts/prepare-vercel-deployment.js
   node scripts/consolidate-for-vercel.js
   ```

2. Obtain Vercel project information:
   ```bash
   node scripts/get-vercel-project-info.js
   ```

3. Add the Vercel configuration to GitHub repository secrets or update the GitHub Actions workflow directly.

4. Commit and push the changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

### Incremental Migration

1. Set up the incremental migration infrastructure:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-incremental-migration.js
   ```

2. Implement feature flags for each component requiring migration.

3. Deploy to Vercel and test each feature in isolation.

4. Gradually roll out features by enabling feature flags in the Vercel dashboard.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Feature Flags

Feature flags are implemented using a combination of:
- Environment variables set in the Vercel dashboard
- URL parameters for testing specific features
- Cookies for persistent user preferences

Example flags include:
- `USE_NEW_CHART_VISUALIZATION`
- `USE_NEW_FORM_HANDLING`
- `USE_NEW_QUESTIONNAIRE`
- `USE_NEW_AI_RECTIFICATION`

### Middleware

The Next.js middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) handles:
1. Feature flag detection from cookies, headers, and URL parameters
2. Optional redirects to legacy system for unmigrated features
3. A/B testing between implementations

### Component Approach

Components are implemented following the feature flag pattern:
1. Legacy implementation (e.g., `LegacyChartVisualization.tsx`)
2. New implementation (e.g., `NewChartVisualization.tsx`)
3. Wrapper component with feature flag logic (e.g., `ChartVisualization.tsx`)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the initial version to Vercel
2. Implement feature flags for each component requiring migration
3. Migrate features one by one, testing each in isolation
4. Monitor performance and user feedback
5. Gradually retire legacy implementations
