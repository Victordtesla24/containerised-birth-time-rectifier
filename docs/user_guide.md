## FAQ

**How accurate is the birth time rectification?**
The accuracy depends on several factors, including the quality of your responses, the number of significant life events you provide, and how distinctive your chart patterns are. In most cases, the system can narrow down your birth time to within a 1-2 hour window with good confidence.

**How many questions will I need to answer?**
The questionnaire is dynamic and adapts based on your responses. Most users answer between 15-25 questions, but complex cases may require more.

**Is my personal information secure?**
Yes, all personal information is encrypted and stored securely. We do not share your data with third parties. See our Privacy Policy for more details.
