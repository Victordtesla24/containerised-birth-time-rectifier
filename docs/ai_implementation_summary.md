# AI Model Routing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the AI model routing system for the Birth Time Rectification API, as specified in the `AI_Models_Implementation.md` requirements. The implementation enables the system to dynamically select the most appropriate AI model based on task complexity, accuracy requirements, and cost-efficiency.

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Dynamic Model Routing

Implemented intelligent model routing based on task types:
- `o1-preview` for high-accuracy astronomical calculations (birth time rectification)
- `GPT-4 Turbo` for natural language explanations
- `GPT-4o-mini` for lightweight auxiliary tasks

### 2. Multi-Task Architecture

Enhanced the UnifiedRectificationModel with a multi-task architecture that combines:
- Tattva (Traditional): 40% weighting
- Nadi: 35% weighting
- KP (Krishnamurti Paddhati): 25% weighting

### 3. Continuous Operation

Improved application performance through:
- Model preloading at application startup
- Proper GPU memory management
- Response caching to reduce API costs
- Fallback mechanisms for when AI is unavailable

### 4. Error Resilience

Added robust error handling:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for API errors
- Graceful fallback to simulation when AI is unavailable
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### 5. Cost Management

Implemented cost optimization through:
- Task-based model selection to use cheaper models when appropriate
- Detailed cost calculation and tracking
- Usage statistics endpoint for monitoring

### 6. Testing Infrastructure

Added comprehensive testing tools:
- Test router for API endpoint testing
- Shell script for automated testing
- Python test suite for unit and integration testing
