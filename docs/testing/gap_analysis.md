1. Chart Retrieval (Step 8)
- What Update Is Required
  - The get_chart() function exists in the script (lines 5778-5851) but it's currently implemented as a mock function that doesn't make actual API calls. It needs to be updated to make real API calls to retrieve chart data.

## Where It Must Be Updated
 - Lines 5778-5851: Replace the mock implementation with a real API call implementation
 - Lines 1798-1799: Add a call to get_chart() after chart generation in the main flow function
 - Lines 1842-1843: Add a call to get_chart() in the interactive test flow
 - Lines 2142-2143: Add a call to get_chart() in the default test flow
## Specific Changes
 - Update the get_chart() function to use actual API calls instead of mocked data:

# Replace lines 5778-5851 with a real implementation that uses requests.get()
# instead of simulating the API call
 - Ensure the function is properly integrated into the main flow by adding calls after chart generation:

# Add after line 1799 in main()
 - chart_data = get_chart(chart_id, session_id)

2. Rectified Chart Retrieval (Step 9)
- What Update Is Required
  - The get_rectified_chart() function exists (lines 5853-5926) but has issues with error handling and is not properly marked with sequence step number 9.

## Where It Must Be Updated
 - Lines 5853-5926: Update the function to handle errors properly and use real API calls
 - Line 5853: Update the function docstring to include sequence step number
 - Line 5873: Fix the sequence step diagram to match the gap analysis recommendation
 - Line 5857: Fix the error handling for missing rectification_id
## Specific Changes
 - Update the error handling for missing rectification_id:

# Replace lines 5857-5860 with proper extraction of rectification_id
rectification_id = rectification_result.get("rectification_id")
if not rectification_id:
    logger.error("No rectification ID found in rectification results")
    print(TermColors.colorize("‚ùå No rectification ID found in rectification results", TermColors.RED))
    raise ValueError("No rectification ID found in rectification results")
Update the API call to use real requests instead of mocking:

# Replace lines 5862-5924 with real API call implementation

3. Export Chart Download (Step 12)
- What Update Is Required
  - The download_chart_export() function exists (lines 5928-5989) but is implemented as a mock function. It needs to be updated to make real API calls and be properly integrated into the flow.

## Where It Must Be Updated
 - Lines 5928-5989: Update the function to use real API calls
 - Lines 1967-1968: Ensure it's consistently called after chart export in all code paths
 - Lines 2267-2268: Add proper calls in the default test flow
## Specific Changes
 - Update the function to use real API calls:

# Replace lines 5928-5989 with real implementation using requests.get()
- Ensure consistent calls after chart export:

# Add after line 1968 in the export chart section
download_result = download_chart_export(download_url, session_id, chart_id)

4. WebSocket Connection Support
- What Update Is Required
  - The WebSocket connection functions (setup_websocket_connection() and handle_websocket_progress()) exist (lines 5991-6093) but only simulate WebSocket behavior rather than implementing actual connections.

## Where It Must Be Updated
 - Lines 5991-6093: Replace simulation with actual WebSocket implementation
 - Line 1842: Add proper WebSocket connection in the rectification process
 - Lines 2142-2143: Add proper WebSocket connection in the default test flow
## Specific Changes
 - Update the WebSocket implementation:

# Replace lines 5991-6093 with real WebSocket implementation using a library like websocket-client
Add proper error handling and reconnection logic:

# Add error handling and reconnection logic to the WebSocket functions
