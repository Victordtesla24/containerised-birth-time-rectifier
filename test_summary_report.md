## Consolidated Testing Approach

The testing approach has been consolidated into a single comprehensive test script that covers all aspects of the application flow. The script includes the following test patterns:

- **Complete Astrological Chart Application Flow**: Tests all 8 steps of the user journey
- **Validation Failure Path**: Tests the A→B→C→B flow when validation fails
- **Low Confidence Path**: Tests the G→H→J→G flow when AI confidence is low
- **Boundary Cases**: Tests edge cases with extreme geographical coordinates
- **API Endpoints Validation**: Tests all required API endpoints from the implementation plan

All tests are now run through the consolidated `run-app-flow-test.sh` script, which provides a consistent interface for running tests in various environments.

### API Integration Points

The API endpoints validation test ensures that all integration points between the frontend and backend are working correctly:

1. The **Birth Details Form** correctly submits to `/api/validate` for validation
2. The **Initial Chart Generation** flow uses `/api/geocode` and `/api/chart/generate`
3. The **Chart Visualization** component consumes data from `/api/chart/{id}`
4. The **Questionnaire** is properly loaded from `/api/questionnaire`
5. The **AI Analysis** submits questionnaire answers to `/api/rectify`
6. The **Export/Share** functionality correctly uses `/api/export`

This comprehensive API testing ensures that all integration points in the application flow are functioning correctly.
